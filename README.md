# SQL_Studyings

In these repositories, I am going to tell things that I've learnt from my course. As you can see in this repository, I've started my SQL journey with SELECT keyword to select the tables. We've learnt to use arithmetic operators, aggregate functions (SUM,COUNT,AVG etc) to calculate, We've learnt to use aliases to give a new name to columns and tables. We've used WHERE keyword to write condition-based queries. We've used GROUP BY keyword to group our table for different columns just like assigning a column name into rows section in the Pivot table at Excel. 

We've learnt to use some other important operators (bitwise, comparison, compound and logical) as well as some other important functions (YEAR,DAY,MONTH etc). Then We'e learnt to use ORDER BY keyword to sort our rows with an ascending or descending order in the table. Also, we've learnt that we can use SELECT TOP keyword to select in a certain amount of records from the top of the table.
